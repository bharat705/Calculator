## Introduction

This project is part of the final assignment for the Odin Project's Fundamentals Course. It combines everything learned throughout the course to create a fully functioning calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The goal is to develop an on-screen calculator that mimics the behavior of real-world calculators. The project emphasizes creating functions to handle basic mathematical operations without using potentially unsafe methods like `eval()`.

## Features

The calculator will include the following capabilities:

- Perform basic math operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Display the results of calculations on-screen.
- Ability to clear the display and reset the calculation.
- Handle sequential operations by evaluating two numbers at a time.
- Round long decimal results to prevent overflow in the display.
- Prevent invalid operations, such as dividing by zero.

## Extra Features (Optional)

- Allow users to input floating-point numbers with a decimal point.
- A “backspace” button to undo the last input.
- Keyboard support for inputting numbers and operations.
- Custom styling to improve the visual appearance, including differentiating the operation buttons from the numeric keypad.

## Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/bharat705/Calculator.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd Calculator
   \`\`\`

3. Open the \`index.html\` file in your browser to start the calculator.
